üß† Replit Agent Prompt: Manual Invoice Creation by Chefs (No Gig Required)
Persona: Full-stack dev building a freelance chef platform (Chef Pantry)
Goal: Allow chefs to create and send invoices manually ‚Äî not tied to a specific gig
Context: Some chefs may work off-platform or get ad hoc work. We want to support them with a flexible invoicing feature.

‚úÖ Functional Requirements:
1. UI Access Point

Add a ‚ÄúCreate Invoice‚Äù button to the Chef‚Äôs Payment Setup dashboard

Placement: under existing Stripe connection or invoice history

Label: ‚ÄúSend an Invoice (No Gig)‚Äù

2. Business Selection Flow

Step 1: Chef enters the business name and location

System should:

Query the business_profiles table

Show confirmation if match is found

If multiple matches, allow chef to select

If no match, display error and block invoice submission

3. Manual Invoice Form
Once the business is confirmed, present a form with:

Service title (text input)

Description of work (textarea)

Hourly rate or fixed amount toggle

Hours worked (if hourly)

Total calculated amount (auto if hourly, manual if fixed)

Optional notes

Option to use connected Stripe account or manually enter bank details (IBAN, sort code, account number)

4. Submit Invoice

On submit:

Save invoice to gig_invoices table with a flag like is_manual = true

Include Stripe payment link if applicable

Trigger a notification for the business in the notifications table

Business user receives it in their dashboard (can view, pay via Stripe, or mark as paid manually)

5. Business Invoice View

Business users should see all invoices (manual + gig-related) in a ‚ÄúPayments‚Äù or ‚ÄúInvoices‚Äù section

For each invoice:

View invoice details

See Stripe Pay link (if used)

Option to ‚ÄúMark as Paid‚Äù manually

üìå Notes:
Reuse existing components from the gig invoice feature to reduce dev time.

The Stripe link should only be shown if the chef has connected Stripe; fallback UI appears if not.

Add a payment_type column if helpful to track (e.g. manual, gig, off_platform).
