You are working on the Chef Pantry marketing site hosted at thechefpantry.co.

Goal:
- Create a dedicated "Privacy Policy" page and wire the existing footer "Privacy Policy" link to this new page.

Context:
- Chef Pantry is a platform connecting freelance chefs with hospitality businesses in the UK.
- The site already has footer links: "Terms of Service", "Privacy Policy", "Cookies".
- Implement this in a way that matches the existing tech stack and routing (React Router, Next.js, plain HTML, etc.).
- The new page must be responsive and follow the current typography and layout style.

Tasks:

1. Inspect the project to understand:
   - How pages/routes are defined.
   - How the footer navigation is implemented.

2. Create a new page/route for the Privacy Policy:
   - Route path should be: `/privacy-policy`
   - The page title (in the browser tab) should be: "Privacy Policy | Chef Pantry".
   - Use the content below as the body of the page.
   - Structure it with headings, subheadings and paragraphs that match the existing design system (e.g. use existing heading and text components if available).
