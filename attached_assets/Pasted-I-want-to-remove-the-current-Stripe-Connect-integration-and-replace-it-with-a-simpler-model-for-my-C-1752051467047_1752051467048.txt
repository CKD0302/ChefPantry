I want to remove the current Stripe Connect integration and replace it with a simpler model for my Chef Pantry app.

Here’s what I need you to do:

---

🎯 GOAL  
Chefs get paid **directly** by businesses using their own Stripe Payment Link or Bank Details. The platform (Chef Pantry) does **not** handle payments or take any cut.

---

🔧 PART 1: Chef Profile Update

Update the `chef_profiles` Supabase table and frontend UI to include:

- `payment_method`: text (`'stripe'` or `'bank'`)
- `stripe_payment_link`: text (if Stripe is selected)
- `bank_sort_code`: text (if Bank is selected)
- `bank_account_number`: text (if Bank is selected)

On the profile setup or edit page for chefs:

- Add a dropdown or radio buttons:
  - Stripe Payment Link
  - Bank Transfer

- If **Stripe** is selected:
  - Show input for Stripe Payment Link (`https://buy.stripe.com/...`)
  - Save it to Supabase

- If **Bank** is selected:
  - Show inputs for Sort Code + Account Number
  - Save to Supabase

---

📤 PART 2: Invoice Submission Flow

When a chef submits an invoice for a gig:

- Auto-fetch the chef’s `payment_method` and relevant fields from Supabase
- Save those in the invoice record (`gig_invoices` table):
  - `payment_method`
  - `payment_link` (if Stripe)
  - `sort_code` and `account_number` (if Bank)

- Do **not** require the chef to re-enter this info each time

---

📥 PART 3: Business View of Invoice

When a business views the invoice:

- If the invoice uses Stripe:
  - Display a “Pay Now” button linking to the `payment_link`
- If the invoice uses Bank:
  - Show the sort code and account number in a clear layout
- Add a button to “Mark as Paid” (optional: updates `status` in Supabase)

---

🧹 PART 4: Clean-up

- Remove any existing Stripe Connect code
  - Delete `stripe.accounts.create`, `accountLinks.create`, or `transfers.create` logic
- Remove any unused `stripe_account_id` or Connect flow references

Let me know if you need to see or modify any specific file (e.g., dashboard, profile setup, invoice submission).
